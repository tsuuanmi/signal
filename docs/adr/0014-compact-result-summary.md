# ADR-0014: Project a Compact Analysis Result Summary

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-25

## Context

`signal.analysis/v4` exposed bounded rolling signal windows, complete called and retained sequences, gapped alignment rows, method identifiers, and rich per-variant peak/vendor evidence. Those fields were useful while establishing the scientific stages, but they duplicated internal state and produced a result larger and more identifying than downstream review requires.

The stable review needs are narrower: deterministic provenance, read/trim extent, merged noisy regions, alignment quality/placement, normalized differences with enough mapped supporting evidence to audit configured eligibility, and warning counts. Full scientific evidence remains available from the identified AB1, reference, configuration, and software revision; it need not be duplicated in every JSON result.

Configuration and result contracts have independent version domains. The signal-processing settings introduced with strict configuration schema version 4 remain scientifically current even though the JSON projection changes.

## Options considered

1. Keep v4 unchanged.
2. Add a second summary file while retaining v4 output.
3. Replace v4 with one compact v5 result and no compatibility output.

Option 1 preserves unnecessary payload and privacy exposure. Option 2 creates two authorities, complicates atomic publication, and violates Signal's one-result boundary. Option 3 keeps one deterministic contract and makes every retained field intentional.

## Decision

Adopt `signal.analysis/v5` as the only scientific result.

V5 retains:

- `software_version`, input AB1 SHA-256, reference name/topology/SHA-256, and configuration SHA-256;
- original read call count and 0-based half-open trim interval;
- merged candidate-noisy call/sample regions with minimum primary SNR;
- selected alignment orientation, callable bases/identity, unresolved bases, gap opens, reference segments, and origin-wrap flag;
- normalized variants with position, reference/alternate alleles, kind, and concise original-call mappings;
- for supporting calls only, `maximum_peak_height` and uncalibrated `relative_quality`, matching the configured variant evidence gates;
- counts of unresolved primary calls, multi-channel unresolved calls, and excluded variant candidates.

V5 removes:

- trace filenames and full primary, ambiguity, and retained sequences;
- individual rolling signal windows and secondary-SNR details;
- gapped query/reference rows, operation runs, alignment score, traceback columns, and redundant alignment counts;
- program/determinism/method constants;
- full A/C/G/T peak height/position/source objects, penalties, Phred flags, and vendor PBAS/PCON data;
- variant contig/classification/normalization labels when the contract already fixes or implies them;
- warning totals, vendor disagreement counts, and duplicated origin-wrap warning state.

Supporting calls preserve role, original call index, PLOC, trace-strand primary/ambiguity, optional biological position, maximum peak height, and relative quality. Flanking calls preserve mapping context only. Inserted supporting calls continue to omit a fabricated biological position; deletions continue to use flanks without fabricated deleted-base evidence.

Strict configuration remains schema version 4. Signal emits no v4 compatibility result, aliases, duplicate fields, VCF/BCF, or alternative output path.

## Consequences

Results are smaller, less identifying, and focused on review decisions while retaining deterministic identities and the exact compact evidence used for supporting-call eligibility. Consumers must migrate to v5 and use the schema rather than rely on removed fields. Detailed reconstruction requires the source AB1, reference, configuration, and identified software version.

Rolling windows, complete sequences, full peaks, vendor evidence, and traceback artifacts remain internal algorithm inputs or diagnostics; removing them from JSON does not change scientific behavior. Candidate-noisy regions remain observation-only. The core CLI continues atomic no-overwrite publication and separate append-only operational logging.

## Relationship to prior decisions

This ADR supersedes only the output projection selected by ADR-0013. ADR-0013 remains accepted for the observation-only `signal.windowed_snr/v1` method, merged-region semantics, configuration schema version 4, and prohibition on noise-driven scientific behavior without validation. ADR-0012's concise mapped-call principle remains in force, with v5 reducing the mapped evidence to supporting maximum peak height and relative quality.
