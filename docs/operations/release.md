# Release Operations

This is the operational companion to ADR-0018.

A release record should identify the exact:

- Signal semantic version;
- source revision;
- Rust/Cargo toolchain;
- Cargo.lock identity;
- supported target triple(s);
- artifact SHA-256;
- schema/config versions;
- dependency audit status;
- CI gate status;
- fuzz/adversarial status required for the release;
- synthetic regression status;
- approved real-AB1 validation status;
- documented runtime and peak-memory measurement.

## Release states

Use explicit language:

- **build verified** — engineering build/check gates passed;
- **scientifically validated for the documented corpus/domain** — approved real-trace evidence passed;
- **production-ready release** — ADR-0018 release contract is satisfied.

Do not collapse these into one status.

## Artifact behavior

Existing versioned scientific JSON contracts must not gain unversioned build metadata. Software/build provenance belongs in a separately designed versioned contract or a new result-schema version when required.
