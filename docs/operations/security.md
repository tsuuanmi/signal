# Security and Trust Boundaries

Signal is a local scientific CLI, but it processes untrusted binary/text input and sensitive biological data.

## Untrusted inputs

Treat as untrusted:

- ABIF/AB1 bytes;
- FASTA bytes;
- TOML configuration;
- filenames and filesystem metadata;
- external manifests/scripts inputs.

Required protections include bounded file sizes, checked arithmetic, checked slices, validated cardinality, allocation caps, and typed failures.

## Rust boundary

First-party production code forbids unsafe Rust. A future unsafe/FFI boundary requires an explicit ADR and targeted safety validation.

## Resource exhaustion

Input-controlled dimensions must be bounded before large allocation. Alignment-cell limits, reference limits, AB1 size caps, and indel limits are correctness/security controls, not just performance settings.

## Filesystem

- result publication is atomic and no-overwrite;
- cleanup scripts validate targets before deletion;
- symlink/path-escape behavior must be explicit;
- scientific failures must not leave a partial result presented as successful.

## Data privacy

Sequences, chromatograms, variant evidence, and sample-linked metadata may be identifying biological data. Logs and test fixtures must follow [data policy](../data.md) and must not leak complete sequences or dense signal payloads unless the contract explicitly requires them.

## Dependencies

Release dependencies are reviewed for known advisories, source policy, licenses, and explicit exceptions as defined by ADR-0018.
