# Current Scientific and Algorithmic Methods

These documents describe current production behavior, not exploratory research.

- [Pipeline](../pipeline.md): authoritative stage sequence and implemented algorithms.
- [Signal processing](../signal-processing.md): rolling SNR method and current limitations.
- [Basecall output](../basecall-output.md): reference-free projection of the shared read pipeline.
- [Analysis output](../json-output.md): reference-guided result semantics.
- [Sample evidence output](../sample-output.md): N-read reconciliation evidence and Tracy-derived overlap admission semantics.
- [Read-local poly-C phase](polyc-phase.md): internal `signal.polyc_phase/v1` continuous candidate evidence after selected alignment.

When a method is still exploratory, document it under `docs/research/<topic>/` instead. Promote it here only when the root production contract adopts it.
