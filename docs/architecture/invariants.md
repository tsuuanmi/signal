# System Invariants

These invariants span modules and are intentionally centralized. SRS and module manuals may reference them but should not redefine them.

## Evidence

- **INV-EVID-001:** Decoded analyzed A/C/G/T channel arrays are immutable source evidence after validation.
- **INV-EVID-002:** Derived signal features, corrected waveforms, quality values, alignments, and variants never overwrite the source evidence from which they were derived.
- **INV-EVID-003:** Vendor PBAS/PCON are vendor evidence, not authoritative Signal output.
- **INV-EVID-004:** `LocusEvidence` and `EvidenceProfile` are derived directly from immutable analyzed A/C/G/T channel values and PLOC-defined geometry; primary/ambiguity calls, selected basecall peaks, and qualifying-channel thresholds MUST NOT determine profile membership or weights.
- **INV-EVID-005:** A zero-positive-signal locus has no evidence profile; the system MUST NOT synthesize a uniform or reference-guided profile as a fallback.
- **INV-EVID-006:** Reference placement MAY consume `EvidenceProfile`, but reference context MUST NOT mutate or rewrite upstream locus evidence or base calls.
- **INV-EVID-007:** PLOC validity and optional vendor-series cardinality are distinct evidence dimensions. Valid PLOC loci remain the authoritative current-method event anchors; PBAS/PCON length mismatch cannot add/remove Signal loci and must remain explicit non-fatal integrity evidence.
- **INV-EVID-008:** Exact signed-16-bit clipping and whole-trace event-signal scale observations are evidence only. They cannot mutate channels, calls, trim bounds, alignment, or variants, and an amplitude ratio cannot become an artifact/dye-blob label without a separately specified method.
- **INV-EVID-009:** A locus evidence event MUST remain anchored to the PLOC-local chromatogram event: among positive local maxima of total corrected A/C/G/T signal inside the locus window, the nearest to PLOC wins before amplitude. A stronger but more distant neighboring event cannot steal the locus profile. If no positive local event exists, PLOC itself is used.

## Coordinates and identity

- **INV-COORD-001:** Trace sample positions, original call indexes, PLOC values, trim bounds, signal-window bounds, and reference segments are 0-based unless a contract explicitly says otherwise.
- **INV-COORD-002:** Reported biological variant positions are 1-based.
- **INV-COORD-003:** Half-open intervals use `[start, end)`.
- **INV-COORD-004:** Call index, trace-sample position, and biological reference position are different coordinate domains and must not be substituted implicitly.
- **INV-ID-001:** Reverse-strand processing preserves the original trace call identity and PLOC.
- **INV-ID-002:** Variant normalization may change reported allele placement without rewriting the observed trace-call mappings.

## Alignment canonicality

- **INV-ALN-001:** Scientific alignment score optimality precedes canonicalization. A right-most gap cannot replace a higher-scoring traceback.
- **INV-ALN-002:** Repeat-equivalent optimal indel placements have one canonical reference-oriented topology: preserve equivalent gap content contiguously where possible, then place it furthest 3' on the rCRS light strand (right-most in ordinary increasing rCRS coordinates).
- **INV-ALN-003:** Canonicalization cannot collapse genuinely different edit explanations or rotate an indel across the rCRS 16569|1 seam.
- **INV-ALN-004:** Alignment topology and serialized variant normalization are separate contracts. A representation-layer convention such as VCF left-normalization cannot silently redefine the authoritative alignment columns.

## Scientific state

- **INV-BIO-001:** Unresolved evidence is not equivalent to a reference call, absence of variation, or absence of coverage.
- **INV-BIO-002:** A mixed/secondary signal is an observation, not automatically heteroplasmy, genotype, contamination, or mixture.
- **INV-BIO-003:** A single chromatogram produces read-level evidence, not a sample-level biological conclusion.
- **INV-BIO-004:** A derived confidence value is not an error probability or Phred score unless separately calibrated and validated.
- **INV-BIO-005:** A strongest canonical base with more than one co-localized qualifying channel is mixed signal evidence, not an ordinary clean substitution. If it yields a normalized SNV observation, the observation remains preserved but is not clean-report eligible.

## Read placement and sample boundaries

- **INV-READ-001:** Every trace is scientifically processed and placed independently before any cross-read reconciliation.
- **INV-READ-002:** Read orientation and covered reference segments are derived from alignment evidence; filename, amplicon/HV label, primer label, and declared F/R direction do not constrain default placement.
- **INV-READ-003:** Cross-read reconciliation uses normalized reference-coordinate/variant space rather than canonical F/R pairs as exclusive merge keys.
- **INV-READ-004:** A missing canonical partner does not invalidate an otherwise admitted read; optional assay metadata remains provenance or post-mapping QC unless a separately specified method explicitly says otherwise.
- **INV-SAMPLE-001:** A future consensus sequence is a downstream projection, not the authoritative source of sample variants or discordance.
- **INV-SAMPLE-002:** Missing coverage is distinct from reference support. For each read, mapped reference segments define coverage; inside coverage, omission from sparse `locus_differences[]` means canonical reference match, while positions outside coverage remain uncovered.
- **INV-SAMPLE-003:** Sample evidence defines read identity, unique reviewer-facing filename stem, orientation, and post-trim coverage once in a SHA-sorted read registry. Public locus and normalized-variant evidence reference reads by that unique name; internal aggregation MAY use deterministic indexes but MUST NOT expose them as reviewer-facing identifiers.
- **INV-SAMPLE-004:** Duplicate trace content cannot be counted twice within one sample evidence result.
- **INV-SAMPLE-005:** A locus record exists only when at least one covering read is alternate, unresolved, or deleted. Every covering read at that retained locus remains explicit so reference support and its focused quality evidence are not lost.
- **INV-SAMPLE-006:** Normalized variant support preserves configured eligibility, exclusion reasons, and reviewer-facing reference-oriented base/peak/quality evidence; internal call mappings remain authoritative for scientific traceability, and read-level filtering MUST NOT erase a normalized observation.
- **INV-SAMPLE-007:** Pairwise overlap is discovered only after independent read placement from shared reference coordinates. Non-overlapping reads have no edge; missing an overlapping or canonical F/R partner does not invalidate a read.
- **INV-SAMPLE-008:** Pairwise nucleotide agreement uses only coordinates where both reads carry canonical A/C/G/T query bases. Unresolved symbols and deletions remain outside that denominator; gap/indel evidence is never converted into fabricated nucleotide agreement.
- **INV-SAMPLE-009:** Overlap eligibility is downstream evidence for future consensus and cannot rewrite read placement, read-level observations, or variant eligibility.
- **INV-SAMPLE-010:** Sample coverage topology derives only from selected mapped reference segments and counts all independently placed reads. It cannot inherit pairwise overlap eligibility as read rejection, and orientation depth is not equivalent to nucleotide agreement, consensus confidence, or biological strand independence.
- **INV-SAMPLE-011:** Normalized-variant support topology is a lossless summary of the existing per-read variant observations across eligibility and selected-orientation dimensions. It cannot add supporting reads, erase ineligible observations, count reference/unresolved/competing-event coverage as support for that variant, or become a confidence/independence verdict.
- **INV-SAMPLE-012:** Basecall-independent nucleotide profiles retained at sample scope must originate from the matching read `LocusEvidence` call index and be projected only by the selected read orientation. Missing profiles remain missing and deletion observations carry no nucleotide profile; sample reconciliation cannot reconstruct profile evidence from called bases or the reference.
- **INV-SAMPLE-013:** Differential-locus support topology is derived only from the explicit observations retained at that reference coordinate. Total reads must equal both the forward/reverse partition and the reference/alternate/unresolved/deletion partition; missing coverage cannot enter either partition and the summary cannot become a vote or confidence verdict.
- **INV-SAMPLE-014:** Local sample noise context is a projection of upstream merged candidate-noisy call regions only. A covered call is not automatically weak, erroneous, ineligible, or down-weighted, and deletion evidence cannot receive fabricated call-specific noise state.
- **INV-SAMPLE-015:** A call-backed sample observation has one authoritative reference-oriented signal projection resolved from matching `LocusEvidence`. Corrected amplitudes, per-channel SNR, profile weights, and noisy-region membership cannot be independently re-derived through competing sample-layer paths; reverse orientation must project every A/C/G/T channel array consistently, and deletions have no call signal object.
- **INV-SAMPLE-016:** Differential-locus profile availability is derived only from retained call signal objects with a present `EvidenceProfile`. Its forward/reverse partition must sum exactly to total profile-bearing reads, it cannot include deletions or missing profiles, and it cannot become contributor eligibility, agreement, weight, or confidence.
- **INV-SAMPLE-017:** Nucleotide contribution eligibility is a separate policy over preserved evidence. The current structural policy admits every call-backed observation with a real profile, rejects missing-profile calls from nucleotide aggregation, and routes deletions to event evidence. Unresolved symbols, relative quality, SNR, and candidate-noisy membership cannot independently erase available profile evidence.
- **INV-SAMPLE-018:** Eligible nucleotide profiles are accumulated with unit read mass only. Total A/C/G/T support is the channel-wise sum of separately retained forward/reverse support, and contributor counts partition by selected orientation. This evidence sum cannot become a consensus call, confidence value, or implicit quality/amplitude/SNR weight.
- **INV-SAMPLE-019:** Mean nucleotide profiles are derived only by dividing an existing unit-mass support partition by its contributor count. Empty partitions have no mean profile. Arithmetic normalization cannot erase contributor counts or become a consensus, confidence, discordance class, or hidden weighting policy.
- **INV-SAMPLE-020:** Profile heterogeneity is decomposed mathematically from eligible normalized profiles into within-profile impurity and between-profile dispersion; their sum reproduces total mean-profile heterogeneity within numerical tolerance. Geometry cannot become a mixed-signal or heteroplasmy verdict without separate validated policy.
- **INV-SAMPLE-021:** Directional profile distance exists only when both forward and reverse mean profiles exist and is the Total Variation distance between those normalized distributions. Orientation comparison cannot imply independent biological replication or become a discordance/confidence threshold by itself.

## Read-local phase evidence

- **INV-PHASE-001:** Future production phase evidence is downstream of selected reference placement. It may consume selected orientation/path and immutable reference-oriented evidence, but it cannot feed back into alignment scoring, orientation selection, traceback, canonicalization, calls, or upstream signal evidence.
- **INV-PHASE-002:** Phase applicability and evidence availability are distinct from interpretation. An unsupported reference/context or insufficient downstream evidence cannot be represented as stable phase, reference support, or absence of instability.
- **INV-PHASE-003:** Read-local phase measurement cannot require a canonical F/R partner or opposite-orientation control. Cross-read orientation evidence remains validation/corroboration unless a separately specified sample policy adopts it.
- **INV-PHASE-004:** Phase evidence cannot alter structural nucleotide-contribution eligibility, the current unit-mass nucleotide-support accumulator, read/variant eligibility, or public calling behavior without a separately accepted and validated reliability policy. No parallel hidden phase-weighted contribution path is permitted.

## Pipeline

- **INV-PIPE-001:** Scientific stages consume validated output from earlier stages and do not silently re-parse or reinterpret external inputs.
- **INV-PIPE-002:** Reference-aware stages do not alter upstream signal-derived base calls.
- **INV-PIPE-003:** Expected external-input failures are explicit typed failures, not panics or silent fallbacks.
- **INV-PIPE-004:** Identical scientific inputs, configuration, algorithm versions, and supported execution environment produce deterministic scientific output.

## Output and operations

- **INV-OUT-001:** A failed core analysis publishes no scientific result.
- **INV-OUT-002:** Core result publication is atomic and does not overwrite an existing result.
- **INV-OUT-003:** Operational logs are separate from deterministic scientific result contracts.
- **INV-OUT-004:** A versioned public schema is not mutated retroactively; incompatible contract changes require a new schema version.
- **INV-OUT-005:** Validation measurement exports are separate ignored local artifacts. They reuse authoritative scientific evidence but cannot alter public result schemas, become production compatibility outputs, or apply research thresholds during export.
- **INV-OUT-006:** Validation event diagnostics expose existing call and signal provenance only. Source chromatogram sample coordinates remain unchanged, while all diagnostic A/C/G/T arrays are projected to the selected reference orientation. Diagnostics cannot reselect events or mutate scientific evidence.

## Rust implementation

- **INV-RUST-001:** First-party production code forbids unsafe Rust and denies deprecated API use; first-party source cannot suppress that diagnostic under the source-policy gate.
- **INV-RUST-002:** Production paths do not use `unwrap` or `expect` for recoverable external conditions.
- **INV-RUST-003:** Types and module boundaries should encode coordinate, topology, strand, and validated-state distinctions when doing so removes a concrete failure mode.
- **INV-RUST-004:** Production source must not hide obsolete code behind deprecated declarations, legacy/backward-compatibility feature paths, compatibility-named declarations, or warning suppressions for deprecated/dead/unreachable/unused code; CI enforces this explicit-source policy in addition to compiler and Clippy diagnostics.
